# Simple Real Estate Django App

This app can be used to post listings (listings can be saved and posted from mobile devices as well), get inquiries, search properties by keywords, city and state, bedrooms, and price. This is a really simple app but it does all the basic things you might need in your business.

## Setting up 
* First, open settings.py and fill in :
> `# Database section`
> `# Email config section`

## P.S.
In the future I'll add docker deployment to this project.
